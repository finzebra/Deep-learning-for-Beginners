# CNN Hands-On Projects

Welcome to the exciting hands-on section! In this module, we'll focus on practical applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and dive into real-world projects that will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of image classification, object detection, and sketch recognition.

By the end of this section, you'll not only know the theory behind CNNs but also have the practical experience to train, implement, and deploy CNN models for various interesting tasks.

## Projects Covered

### 1. Train a CNN to Classify Cats vs. Dogs
#### Project Overview
In this project, we will train a CNN model to distinguish between cats and dogs in images. This will give you the opportunity to apply the principles of CNNs to a classic image classification task. The dataset will consist of labeled images of cats and dogs, which we will preprocess and use to train the model.

#### Skills You Will Learn:
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Building a CNN model from scratch
- Training and evaluating the model
- Using callbacks like EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting
- Saving and loading models for inference

### 2. Implement Real-time Object Detection
#### Project Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll use pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) to implement real-time object detection. The goal is to build a model that can detect and classify objects (such as people, cars, or animals) in live video streams or images. This will require you to understand how CNNs can be applied not only to classify images but also to locate objects within them.

#### Skills You Will Learn:
- Object detection architectures (YOLO, SSD)
- Image annotation and bounding box creation
- Handling video streams
- Using pre-trained models for real-time applications
- Visualizing detections on images and videos

### 3. Build an AI that Recognizes Hand-Drawn Sketches
#### Project Overview
In this project, we will build a model that can classify hand-drawn sketches into predefined categories (such as "cat", "car", "house", etc.). This project focuses on transferring the power of CNNs to identify simple shapes, which is a fantastic introduction to how AI can recognize sketches and drawings. Youâ€™ll also get a chance to explore datasets like the "Quick, Draw!" dataset from Google.

#### Skills You Will Learn:
- Image preprocessing for sketches
- Building custom CNN architectures
- Transfer learning using pre-trained models
- Evaluating model performance and accuracy
- Using CNNs for creative tasks like drawing recognition

## Why This Module Stands Out

- **Real-world applications**: These projects have a direct impact on AI applications like self-driving cars, sketch recognition, and automated image classification.
- **Hands-on learning**: Instead of just reading about theory, you will implement everything yourself, experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
- **Real-time object detection**: Dive into the real-time capabilities of CNNs and learn how to apply them to live applications.
- **Creativity**: By building AI that can recognize hand-drawn sketches, you can tap into the artistic side of AI and understand how neural networks can be used in creative fields.

## What's Inside the Code?
By exploring the GitHub repository, you'll have access to code snippets and scripts that demonstrate how to:

- Preprocess images for efficient training
- Build CNN models from scratch with real-time feedback
- Use transfer learning to boost model performance
- Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results
- Implement advanced techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting

This is **NOT** just another tutorial â€” itâ€™s hands-on, real-world AI!

## Get Started
Begin with the **Cats vs Dogs classification project**, where you can:

- Load, preprocess, and augment the dataset.
- Build a simple CNN model.
- Train it to classify images of cats and dogs.
- Evaluate its performance on test data and visualize the results.
